# Document Template System: Implementation Summary

This document outlines the features implemented for the document template and generation system.

## Summary of Implemented Features

We have successfully built the foundational document template and generation system.

*   **Database Schema**:
    *   Created a migration file at [`supabase/migrations/20250728103400_create_doc_template_tables.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250728103400_create_doc_template_tables.sql) which defines the `doc_template` and `doc_generated_document` tables.
*   **Template Management**:
    *   A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing templates is now available.
    *   The list page is at [`/system/doc-templates`](src/routes/(app)/system/doc-templates/).
    *   The create/edit page is at [`/system/doc-templates/edit/[[id]]`](src/routes/(app)/system/doc-templates/edit/[[id]]/).
*   **Core Logic**:
    *   A `DocumentGenerationService` at [`src/lib/services/document-generation.service.ts`](src/lib/services/document-generation.service.ts) handles the core logic of fetching data and rendering templates using Mustache.js.
*   **Template Features**:
    *   Templates support a dynamic `context_schema` field, allowing them to define what data they need.
    *   A "Preview" feature on the edit page allows for immediate testing of template designs.
*   **Document Generation UI**:
    *   A dedicated page for generating documents is now live at [`/crm/generate-document`](src/routes/(app)/crm/generate-document/).
    *   This page dynamically builds its UI based on the selected template's `context_schema`, allowing users to select the required data.
    *   The generated document is displayed in a dialog.

## Potential Next Steps (for new tasks)

Here are some well-defined next steps you could request in a new task to build upon this system:

1.  **Implement PDF Generation and Printing**:
    *   Add a "Print" and "Download PDF" button to the dialog that displays the generated document.
    *   Use the browser's native `window.print()` functionality with print-specific CSS (`@media print`) for a lightweight solution.

2.  **Build a User-Friendly Schema Editor**:
    *   On the template edit page, replace the raw JSON textarea for `context_schema` with a user-friendly interface.
    *   This UI would allow users to add/remove "roles" with dropdowns to select the `source_table`, making it easier to define a template's data requirements without writing JSON.

3.  **Display Generated Documents on Contact Page**:
    *   On the Contact edit page (`/crm/contacts/edit/[[id]]`), add a new tab or section.
    *   This section should list all documents that have been generated for that specific contact.
    *   Each item in the list should link to a view of that historical document.

4.  **Enhance the Preview and Generation Dialogs**:
    *   Currently, the data selection dropdowns use sample or globally-loaded data.
    *   Enhance them to fetch lookup data dynamically based on the `source_table` defined in the template's schema.
