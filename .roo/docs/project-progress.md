# Project Progress

## Current Focus

- Implementing catalog tooling with rich product attribute management.
- Hardening reusable UI components (e.g. Combobox error layout) for consistent forms.
- Aligning new features with Smart CRUD and list loader patterns for Supabase-backed entities.

## Completed Milestones

- Environment bootstrapped with SvelteKit, Supabase, Shadcn-Svelte, Tailwind, Zod, ky.
- Smart CRUD stack and list loader patterns codified in `.roo/rules`.
- Product attribute data model designed (attribute sets, options, value tables).
- `Combobox` component refactor prevents layout shifts when displaying validation errors.
- Comprehensive Svelte 5 / SvelteKit knowledge captured in documentation (`tech-context`, `system-patterns`, `project-overview`).

## Outstanding Work

- Build catalog pages with filtering, sorting, pagination powered by `createListPageLoader`.
- Implement Supabase-authenticated flows (consider Lucia or session middleware).
- Flesh out CRUD forms for remaining entities using standard `SmartForm` configuration.
- Integrate advanced routing and layout patterns (route groups, shallow routing) where beneficial.
- Set up dedicated error pages and structured Supabase error toasts across modules.
- Apply image optimization (`@sveltejs/enhanced-img`) and accessibility audits to production pages.
- Automate SEO metadata population and consider sitemap generation.

## Known Issues / Risks

- No automated test suite; rely on `pnpm run check` + `pnpm run lint` and targeted manual QA.
- Cloudflare type bindings must be regenerated (`pnpm run cf-typegen`) whenever worker config changes to prevent runtime mismatches.
- Structured Supabase error handling depends on services returning canonical payloads; custom responses can break client toasts.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize catalog CRUD flows leveraging existing patterns (service + payload + SmartForm).
2. Wire authentication guardrails via hooks and Supabase session validation.
3. Incrementally replace remaining ad-hoc tables/forms with Smart CRUD/List implementations.
4. Document additional domain-specific processes inside `.roo/docs/` as they stabilize.
