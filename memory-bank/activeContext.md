# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

*   The user is currently working on the product catalog functionality, specifically on product attributes implementation, as indicated by the open tabs for product-related files.
*   The focus is on designing and implementing a flexible product attributes system that can handle different attribute types (single-select, multi-select, text, numeric, boolean, date).

**Recent Changes:**

*   Added comprehensive Svelte 5 knowledge to the memory bank, including information about runes, reactivity, event handling, snippets, component instantiation, and state management.
*   Added detailed SvelteKit project structure information to the memory bank.
*   Added documentation about Web Standards in SvelteKit, including Fetch APIs, FormData, Stream APIs, URL APIs, and Web Crypto.
*   Added extensive documentation on advanced SvelteKit features, including:
    * Advanced routing (rest parameters, optional parameters, parameter matching, route sorting, encoding, advanced layouts)
    * Hooks (server, shared, and universal)
    * Error handling
    * Link options
    * Service workers
    * Server-only modules
    * Snapshots
    * Shallow routing
    * Packaging
*   Added SvelteKit best practices to the memory bank, including:
    * Authentication and authorization approaches
    * Performance optimization techniques
    * Image handling and optimization
    * Accessibility considerations
    * SEO optimization strategies

**Next Steps:**

*   Apply Svelte 5 best practices to the catalog page implementation.
*   Ensure proper use of runes, event attributes, and snippets in the codebase.
*   Leverage SvelteKit's web standards-based approach for efficient development.
*   Implement advanced routing techniques where appropriate.
*   Consider using hooks for cross-cutting concerns.
*   Utilize server-only modules for sensitive operations.
*   Implement proper error handling with custom error pages.
*   Optimize images using @sveltejs/enhanced-img.
*   Ensure accessibility through proper titles, focus management, and ARIA attributes.
*   Implement SEO best practices with proper metadata and performance optimization.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to efficiently fetch and display catalog data.
*   How to implement filtering, sorting, and pagination for the catalog.
*   How to ensure data consistency and integrity.
*   How to leverage Svelte 5 features for improved reactivity and component structure.
*   How to best utilize SvelteKit's web standards approach for optimal performance and developer experience.
*   Whether to use advanced layout techniques like route grouping for better organization.
*   How to implement proper error handling and recovery.
*   Whether to use snapshots for preserving form state during navigation.
*   How to structure the application to properly separate server-only code from client code.
*   Which authentication approach to use (sessions vs. tokens).
*   How to optimize images and other assets for performance.
*   How to ensure the application is accessible to all users.
*   How to implement SEO best practices for better search engine visibility.
