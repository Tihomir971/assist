# Progress

**What Works:**

*   The project is set up with SvelteKit, Supabase, Shadcn-Svelte, sveltekit-superforms, Tailwind CSS, Zod, and ky.
*   The project has a basic file structure.
*   Comprehensive Svelte 5 knowledge has been documented in the memory bank.
*   Detailed SvelteKit project structure and web standards information has been added to the memory bank.
*   Advanced SvelteKit features have been documented, including routing, hooks, error handling, link options, service workers, server-only modules, snapshots, shallow routing, and packaging.
*   SvelteKit best practices have been documented, including authentication, performance optimization, image handling, accessibility, and SEO.
*   A comprehensive product attributes schema design has been created, supporting multiple attribute types (single-select, multi-select, text, numeric, boolean, date) with attribute sets for organizing attributes by product type.
*   The `Combobox` component (`src/lib/components/forms/combobox.svelte`) has been updated to prevent layout shifts when error messages are displayed by ensuring the error container reserves space.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Implement the catalog page functionality.
*   Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination for the catalog.
*   Implement user authentication (consider Lucia for session-based auth).
*   Implement CRUD operations for data management.
*   Implement a responsive and accessible UI.
*   Apply Svelte 5 best practices throughout the codebase.
*   Leverage SvelteKit's web standards approach for optimal performance.
*   Implement advanced routing techniques where appropriate.
*   Set up proper error handling with custom error pages.
*   Consider using hooks for cross-cutting concerns.
*   Utilize server-only modules for sensitive operations.
*   Optimize images using @sveltejs/enhanced-img.
*   Ensure accessibility through proper titles, focus management, and ARIA attributes.
*   Implement SEO best practices with proper metadata and performance optimization.

**Current Status:**

*   The project is in the early stages of development.
*   The user is currently working on the catalog page.
*   Svelte 5 knowledge has been added to the memory bank to guide future development.
*   SvelteKit project structure and web standards information has been documented to improve development practices.
*   Advanced SvelteKit features have been documented to enable more sophisticated implementation patterns.
*   SvelteKit best practices have been documented to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and SEO.

**Known Issues:**

*   No known issues are explicitly mentioned.
